# Algorithm Testing with `unittest`

This README provides instructions for running unit tests for algorithms implemented in Python using the `unittest` framework.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have:

- Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).

## Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

2. To run the unit tests for a specific algorithm, follow these steps:

   a. Import the methods from the algorithm file into the test file. For example:

   ```python
   # Import the methods from the algorithm file
   from algorithms.algorithm_file import method1, method2
   ```

   b. Initialize a test class within the test file. Define test methods within the class. For each test method:

   - Write the necessary logic to set up inputs or execute the algorithm.
   - Define the expected result.
   - Use `self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)` to check if the actual result matches the expected result.

   ```python
   import unittest
   from algorithms.algorithm_file import method1, method2

   class TestName(unittest.TestCase):
       def test_method1(self):
           # Define inputs and expected result
           input_data = ...
           expected_result = ...

           # Execute the method
           result = method1(input_data)

           # Check if the result matches the expected result
           self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

       def test_method2(self):
           # Define inputs and expected result
           input_data = ...
           expected_result = ...

           # Execute the method
           result = method2(input_data)

           # Check if the result matches the expected result
           self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```
    The ``` if __name__ == '__main__':``` block ensures that the script is running directly and not being imported as a module into another script. When a Python script is executed, the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`, indicating that it is the main program being run.
    
   c. Run the tests using the following command:

   ```
   python -m unittest tests.test_file
   ```

   Replace `algorithm_file`, `method1`, `method2`, `TestName`, `test_method1`, and `test_method2` with the appropriate names from your project.

4. The tests will run, and you will see the test results in the terminal.

5. Review the test results to ensure that your algorithms are working correctly.
